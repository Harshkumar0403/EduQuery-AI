Introduction to PyTorch for Deep \\nLearning  \\nPyTorch for Deep Learning - A Game Changing Deep Learning Framework  \\nWelcome to the world of PyTorch  - a deep learning framework that has changed and re -\\nimagined the way we build deep learning models.  \\n  \\nPyTorch was recently voted as the favorite deep learning framework among researchers. It has \\nleft TensorFlow behind and continues to be the deep learning  framework of choice for many \\nexperts and practitioners.  \\n  \\nPyTorch is super flexible and is quite easy to grasp, even for deep learning beginners. If you \\nwork on deep learning and computer vision projects, you ’ll love working with PyTorch.  \\n2. Introduction to Python  \\n Why Python and how popular is it for Data Science?  \\n\\uf0b7 Python has rapidly become the go -to language in the data science space and is among \\nthe first things recruiters search for in a data scientist\\'s skill set.  \\n\\uf0b7 It consistently ranks top in global da ta science surveys and its widespread popularity will \\nonly keep on increasing in the coming years.  \\uf0b7 Over the years, with strong community support, this language has obtained a dedicated \\nlibrary for data analysis and predictive modelling.  \\n \\n \\nThis python data science course will help you learn Python libraries like Pandas and use them \\nefficiently for data science and data analysis. Are you ready to power up your career and learn \\nthe best data science language?  \\n3. Pandas for Data Analysis in Python  \\nLearn Pandas - The Most Popular and Useful Python Library for Data Science  \\nPandas is one of the most popular Python libraries in data science. In fact, Pandas is among \\nthose elite libraries that draw instant recognition from programmers of all backgrounds, from \\ndevelop ers to data scientists.  \\nAccording to a recent survey by StackOverflow, Pandas is the 4th most used library/framework \\nin the world. That is quite an achievement!  \\nPandas is the first library we import when we fire up our Jupyter notebooks (‘import pandas as \\npd’ is indelibly etched in our minds!). It is a super flexible tool that enables us to perform data \\nanalysis and data manipulation on Pandas dataframes in double -quick time.  \\n4. Tableau for Beginners  \\nGet Started with Tableau for Data Visualization, Analytic s and Business Intelligence  \\nTableau is the gold standard in business intelligence, analytics and data visualization tools. \\nTableau Desktop (and now Tableau Public) have transformed the way we interact with \\nvisualizations and tell data stories to our client s, stakeholders, and to non -technical audiences \\naround the world.  \\nTableau has been recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and \\nBusiness Intelligence Platforms for 8 straight years. Here ’s Gartner ’s most recent ranking in \\n2020:  \\nDo you need to know programming to learn Tableau?  \\nNot at all. Tableau thrives as a drag -and-drop tool (for the most part). That ’s the beauty of \\nTableau to be honest, you can quickly get started and build awesome visualizations without \\nhaving to get into any coding or programming.  But knowing simple Excel formulas, such as IF -ELSE, will help you with feature engineering in \\nTableau. And that is a critical part of a business intelligence analysts skillset.  \\n  \\nWhat kind of projects can you perform using Tableau?  \\nYou can take up all sorts of analytics projects next. We suggest heading over to the  DataHack \\nplatform  and picking up any project that catches your interest. Load the dataset into Tableau \\nand get going!  \\n5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) \\nfrom Scratch  \\nLearn about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from Scratch  \\nConvolutional Neural Networks, or CNN as they ’re popularly called, are the go -to deep learning \\narchitecture for computer vision tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, facial \\nrecognition, among others. CNNs have even been extended to the field of video analysis!  \\nIf you are picking one deep learning architecture to learn and are not sure where to start, you \\nshould go for convolutional  neural networks. Deep learning enthusiasts and experts with CNN \\nknowledge are being widely sourced in the industry.  \\nIt’s your time to use this CNN skillset and shine!  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.
